    "\n",
    "We see that the randomly selected toxic comments directed towards 'female' had a mean toxicity prediction 75.4% while 'male' had a mean toxicity prediction of 71.4%. Although the toxicity might be higher on average because we initally filtered it with different toxicity labels, the difference between the toxicity scores supports my hypothesis that the Perspective API performance has a bias when evaluating comments containing male and female pronouns. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this test has many variables that are unaccounted for such as the different content, themes, length, punctuation, capitzation, etc. within the comments. All of these factors uniquely influence each comment. To better determine if the Perspective API is biased specifically to pronoun usage, I will conduct another test to evaluate if there is a difference in the scores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote 9 unique comment templates by looking through the original dataset. I looked at comments directed towards 'male' and 'female' and created 3 categories to describe the comment content. The 3 categories were 'insult', 'sexual/obscene', and 'threat'. I then further separated them in order of toxicity levels (low, med, high). \n",
    "\n",
    "In total there are 18 comments in the sample.\n",

    "### Results\n",
    "In the controlled dataset the average toxicity score of the 18 random comments directed towards 'Female' received a higher score that those directed towards the 'Male' individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 6/9 subcategory pairings, the comment with female pronouns was given a higher toxicity score by the Perspective API than the corresponding male pronoun comment despite having the exact same text content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2/9 subcategory pairings, the female and male directed comments were given the same toxicity score by the Perspective API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1/9 subcategory pairings, the comment with male pronouns was given a higher toxicity score than that of the comment with female pronouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Percent Drop in Toxicity from Comments Directed Towards Females to Comments Directed Towards Males:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSULT\n",
    "- Insult-Low-Toxicity: 6%\n",
    "- Insult-Med-Toxicity: 11%\n",

    "Factors that Influenced Results:\n",
    "Low Sample Size:\n",
    "Having a low sample size of 18 comments impacts the reliability of my results and increases the probability that my results are due to random chance. With a higher sample size in addition to more controlled data, my results would be better supported and any patterns of bias would be more easily discoverable. I learned that specificity in the data is extremely useful to when evaluating a single factor in the data ~ such as different pronouns in comments that have the same exact structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "Perspective API had a bias towards labelling comments with male pronouns (he/him/his) with a lower toxicity score than those containing female pronouns (she/her/hers). Users who come across toxic comments that are directed towards 'female' (contain feminine pronouns) will be more likely to leave a discussion than when those comments are directed to 'male (contain male pronouns)."
